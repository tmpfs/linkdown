Each downloaded file is written to a temporary file and passed to the validator.

When no \fB\-\-format\fR option is given the output format is set to JSON, the response document is parsed and printed to the screen.

When the \fB\-\-format\fR option is given the raw validator output is printed to stdout, the first line is the remote URL, followed by the validator output followed by a newline.
